### Rules to Calculate Digit Sum

$$Rule-1$$ Digit sum is simply the sum of all digits in a number.  

		for example- the digit sum of 413 is 8.
        

$$Rule-2$$ Digit sum should be a single digit number.  

    	for example- Digit sum of 2134 is 1. This achieved like so-  
		2 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10 & then we do 1 + 0 to get to 1.

$$Rule-3$$ Ignore 9 or combinations of number that adds upto 9 to find the digit sum.  

    	Digit sum for 2194 after applying Rule-3, digit sum = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7. 
		lets include the 9 and see what happens, digit sum = 2 + 1 + 9 + 4 = 16  
		& applying Rule-2, digit sum = 1 + 6 = 7. So including or excluding nine in  
		digit sum calculation doesnot make a difference hence it saves time to  
		exclude nine or combinations that adds upto nine.  
		
		Another example- 6391. Digit sum = 1.
		
		Lets find digit sum of 7299243. Digit sum = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9.  
		
		One important lesson keep the last nine with you.
        

> Where is digit sum used?  
> It is a good tool to check if LHS = RHS in various situation and mostly in competitive exams.  

### Lets use digit Sum to Check Addition.

**Question** - lets say you have added 934 & 645 to get 1579 and now wants to cross check your answer, What do you do?  

> The digit sum of LHS is always equal to RHS no matter what elementary operations one does.  
> So here lets check if digit sum of LHS = Rhs in our above question 

    	digit sum of 934 = 7  
		digit sum of 645 = 6  
		digit sum of 1579 = 4 = digit sum of RHS  
		
		digit sum of LHS = 7 + 6 = 13 = 4  
		
		therefore digit sum of LHS = 4 = digit sum of RHS

Similarly it is possible to cross check subtraction, multiplication and divison.

### HOW TO PRACTISE DIGIT SUM?

> Even though digit sum is trivial but practising every morning along with various tables will result in improved focus and faster calculation especially for people preparing for competitive exams.  
> While calculating tell aloud the result of your addition. For example, if your adding 9 with 4 tell aloud 13, dont waste time by uttering 9 & 4 loudly. In essence do additon silently in your head and tell aloud the result as you move from left to right.
> As you move from left to right convert the two digit addition results into single digit.  
> for example think about 934, the first result is 12 convert it into 3.
