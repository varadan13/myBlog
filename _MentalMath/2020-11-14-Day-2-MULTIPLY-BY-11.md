### Multiplication by 11.

There are steps to multiply by 11:  
I am going to call a number that is multiplied by 11 as the multiplicand

	
		step 1 - The first number of the multiplicand is put down as the   
		left-hand number of the answer.  
		
		step 2 - Each successive number of the multiplicand is added to  
		its neighbour to the left.  
		
		step 3 - The last number of the multiplicand becomes the   
		right-hand number of the answer.
   

### ILLUSTRATIONS.

1.  $$325 * 11$$ 
    > step 1      $$325 * 11$$ = $$3$$ \_ \_ \_  
    > step 2-1   $$325 * 11$$ = $$35$$ _ \_  
    > step 2-2    $$325 * 11$$ = $$357$$ _  
    > step 3      $$325 * 11$$ = $$3575$$   

2.  $$586 * 11$$ 
    > step 1      $$586 * 11$$ = $$5$$ \_ \_ \_  
    > step 2-1   $$586 * 11$$ = $$63$$ _ \_   
    > step 2-2    $$586 * 11$$ = $$644$$ _  
    > step 3      $$586 * 11$$ = $$6446$$   

Here, in step 2-1, 5 + 8 = 13 and 1 is being carried over to the left hand side  
hence we get 63 after adding 1 to 5. The same trick is used in step 2-2. This carrying over concept must be used whereever is applicable.  

3.  $$9456 * 11$$  
    > step 1      $$9456 * 11$$ = $$9$$ \_ \_ \_ \_  
    > step 2-1   $$9456 * 11$$ = $$103$$ _ \_ \_   
    > step 2-2   $$9456 * 11$$ = $$1039$$ _ \_   
    > step 2-3   $$9456 * 11$$ = $$10401$$ _  
    > step 3      $$9456 * 11$$ = $$104016$$ 

    > PRACTISE : TAKE A CALCULATOR ENTER RANDOM 4 OR 5 OR x DIGIT NUMBER. USE THIS METHOD TO FIND THE ANSWER OF ITS PRODUCT WITH 11 (WITHOUT PEN OR PAPER) THEN HIT ENTER IN THE CALCY TO CROSS CHECK YOUR ANSWER.
