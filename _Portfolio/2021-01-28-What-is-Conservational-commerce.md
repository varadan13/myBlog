In 2016, [Chriss Messina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Messina_(open-source_advocate)) the founder of hashtags coined the term conversational commerce and the definition according to him, "Conversational commerce is about delivering convenience, personalization, and decision support while people are on the go, with only partial attention to spare." Before the emergence of messaging as the dominant mode of communications, brands needed to rely on things like phone calls, emails, live chat and in-store representatives to actually talk to and provide convenience to their consumers and today with technological improvements it is feasible for various enterprises to deploy chatbots in many different ways and in many different combination to maximise their consumer experience.

### How does Conversational Commerce creates a more natural Brand-Consumer relationships?

Instead of relying on one-way email marketing, digital ads or other traditional brand messages, brands can use conversational commerce to create a stronger relationship with every question, statement, assertion and declaration made in a conversation. Consumers are also growing to prefer messaging businesses instead of getting spammed with the same old marketing messages. Conversational commerce makes interacting with a brand more attractive: when they engage with a brand, they know they’ll learn something that will let them achieve their goals, get what they need, or just buy something they’ll love. Also when chatbots are integrated properly into the brands online presence consumers find it quick and easy to buy because the arduous task of finding the suitable material to buy becomes easy when the chatbot provides personalised advice and recommendations. **The experience of shoping will be fun and informative for the consumers.**
