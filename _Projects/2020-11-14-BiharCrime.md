Description: 'Does Jungle Raj narrative ring true today for the Biharis?'

Project Proposal  

I want to find out if Bihar is infact plagued by crime and whether the jungle Raj narrative of the NDA government in fact ring true in the current world.

Data I am intending to use is from National Crime Records Bureau. These guys release in depth statistics on the state of crime every two years.  

I must scrap data from yearly reports of National Crime Records Bureau which is in pdf format. 

Project in development.
