According to [this](https://hackernoon.com/instagrams-billion-dollar-mind-trick-internal-triggers-873dae511021) Hacker Noon article Instagram is technology properly immersed with human psychology.  

-   Most people don't realise that they are hooked.
-   When a product is tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a pre-existing habit, it creates an “internal trigger.” For example, we use twitter when we are bored and facebook when we are bored and feel lonesome.  

So how to manufacture these internal triggers?  

-   The developers had to get users to spend  their attention on the application to do this the developers had to manufacture desire to use the product.  
    > 1.  The slogan of “Fast beautiful photo sharing,” conveys the purpose of the service.  
    > 2.  Advertisements of their use cases through other popular social media platforms.   
    > 3.  After clicking through from external triggers (i.e., ads in social media) users are prompted to install the app and they begin using it for the first time. The minimalist interface all but removes the need to think.  
    > 4.  With a click, a photo can be uploaded and all sorts of positive feedbacks ensue.  
    > 5.  This mental attack through positive reinforcement changes the mind and establishes a new internal trigger. Now users visit instagram to check the cool images and lives of the people in their network.   

### Why we buy things and put up our best lives on social media?

We constantly measure our social value relative to others. It is the most important incentive and motivating force of social behavior. Negative situations like loneliness can vitalise the materialist in us and we find pleasure and derive social status by buying more and more stuff and displaying them through the social media. This behaviour exhibits constant growth because  negative situation trumps the behaviour of buying new stuff and displaying through social media and that results in the formation of more negative emotions. People who are hooked seldom realise this or would want to escape the charade. This fact is infact the fuel of almost all social media platforms in the earth.
