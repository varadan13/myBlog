### What is the difference between Language and Languages?

A First approximation answer which will be refined later.  
'What is a car?' when thinking about this statement we don't care which type a car is rather we are interested in the idea of a car i.e., the image that we hold in our mind is the body of car, having four wheels, presence of steering wheel etc Likewise 'Language' means the underlying grammar, the sounds, the relationship between the grammar and the sounds etc. Every languages must be similar in the sense that they have all an underlying principle governing them. The differences in languages are located in their parameters some languages like Tamil are verb ending whereas languages like English are verb middle languages.

### What is language?

Language is a system comprising all the underlying principles and parameters and the relationships between the principles and parameters that governs the natural spoken language of human beings. 

# 

### Why must we think that languages have an underlying structure?

### What is languages?

Examples of languages are English, Kannada, Malayalam, etc.

### How do kids learn the langauges spoken in their house without any formal training?

When we are kids we have a natural talent for acquiring languages. We need no nudges or scary exams to learn this stuff which we find difficult as adults. As kids we are not just learning to speak a language but we are learning the underlying principles as well. So if we are learning the underlying principles behind languages do we know them? Yes, we know them but most human beings can't systematically express them or modify them and thereby speak a new language. As kids what transpires in our brains?

Animals use sound signals to communicate. [Find examples]. Animals also communicate through various different means. [Find more examples] For example, crabs communicate by waving their claws, bees have an elaborate system of dance etc. 

Human language has the property of arbitrariness. For example 'elephant' represents an elephant but there is nothing in the word 'elephant' that makes us want to associate it with the animal. If its possible we could now send a notification to everybody in the planet stating that from today 'pontobello' should be used instead of 'elephant' to represent an elephant and that could work. So the associations of words to idea in our languages are completely arbitrary and that is not the case with animal communication. [Find examples].

### A Thought Experiment.

Suppose two animals are bred in captivity and in isolation. The animals are a monkey and a human. Now after maturity we release them into the wild. Monkey is released into a jungle and Human is released into a metropolis. Who among them will communicate well with their fellow creatures? The answer is the monkey will do fine. With a little bit  of effort he can communicate with the animals but the human will not be able to communicate because our language cannot be learned in captivity and infact our verbal system of communication needs to be learned and whatever little verbal communication that monkeys have are imprinted into their genome so they don't have to undergo years of aprenticeship that we humans must do to get our little selfs tuned to our languages.
