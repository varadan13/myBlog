### DATA ANALYTICS AND STATISTICS PROJECT

I have hosted some of my finished and unfinished works in my [github profile](https://github.com/varadan13/Projects_and_Notes)

-   [Kerala Assembly Election Analytics](https://github.com/varadan13/Projects_and_Notes/tree/main/Kerala-Assembly-Election-Analytics)
    > -   The 2021 Kerala Legislative Assembly election is scheduled to be held in May of this year to elect 140 MLAs to the 15th Kerala Legislative Assembly.    
    > -   I am not a political pundit but I thought to myself it would be nice to know how various individuals and various other political parties fared in the previous elections.   
    > -   The data was collected from the website of Election Commission of India. The ipython notebook is semi interactive.  
    > -   In the future I plan to collect demographic data from Registar General office of India and conduct a more detailed study combining both the data set.  

-   [Flight delay prediction](https://github.com/varadan13/Projects_and_Notes/blob/main/flight_delay_predictions.ipynb)  
    > -   I developed a model aimed at predicting flight delays. The intended purpose of this project was not to obtain the best possible prediction but rather to emphasize on the various steps needed to build such a model.  
    > -   During the EDA, I intended to create good quality figures from which the information would be easily accessible at a first glance.  

-   [A Climate Change Visualisation Project](https://github.com/varadan13/Projects_and_Notes/tree/main/A-Climate-Change-Visualisation-Project)    
    > -   This project is unfinished and the questions I am trying to tackle here are:
    >     > -   What are the ten most countries that suffer from temperature change mostly in the last ten years?  
    >     > -   What are the ten countries that suffer from temperature change at the very least in the last ten years?
    >     > -   Is there any significant difference between seasons? 
    >     > -   What is the trend of temperature change in the world?
    > -   The main libraries I am using are Pandas, NumPy for data wrangling and Matplotlib, Plotly for data visualization.   

-   Meta-analysis to evaluate the success rates of various surgical techniques for socket preservation in the esthetic zone.  
    > -   I had to unwillingly help a friend of friend of mine during the lockdown period to run the inference part of this project and I don't think I did a good job but I value the effort that I took to first learn what is meta analysis and how to solve various practical difficulties involved in this project.  
    > -   I was able to successfully extract all the possible treatment effects from the sampled research materials and then use random effect model to draw inference.  
    > -   The software that I used in this project was Revman.

### OTHER PROJECTS

-   [Created a static website for myself and hosted it in Github.](https://github.com/varadan13/varadan13.github.io)   
    > -   There are hundred different ways to have a blog but I choose a semi-difficult way to create a blog for my own.  
    > -   I used Jekyll to create my static website. Jekyll is semi difficult to work backwards where to use the liquid templating language appropriately or to understand the mistakes that one makes during the configuration or how to put together various elements etc
    > -   I build the website first in my local machine and then pushed my local repo to the remote github repo.   
    > -   Today, it is easy for me to understand various static site generators, for example, Pelican a python static site generator. 

-   [Implementing One Way Anova in Python From Scratch.](https://github.com/varadan13/Projects_and_Notes/blob/main/Lecture%20Notes/Sampling%20theory%20and%20linear%20regression%20analysis/Implementing_ANOVA_from_scratch.ipynb)

-   Deconstruction of the analysis made in the research paper titled 'Norms and economic motivation in household recycling: Empirical evidence from Sweden’ by Hage et al. 2009'   
    > On January 2021 BBC in its show 'The Inquiry' had aired an episode titled 'Is Recycling Broken?' in which the experts where talking about the state of recycling in our world and how Sweden successfully manages its waste recycling. The above paper systematically studies various aspects of Swedish recycling system and I in this deconstruction essay I tried to answer questions such as:
    >
    > > -   What kind of question is this paper trying to answer?  
    > > -   Is the data used in the paper sufficient to answer the questions?
    > > -   What are the main sections of the paper? 
    > > -   What are the assumptions made in the paper?
    > > -   What is the model used in the paper?  
    > > -   Are the results replicable
    > > -   etc.
