### What is Jekyll?

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by [Tom Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner), GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under the open source MIT license.  
> Jekyll started a web development trend towards static websites. As of 2017, Jekyll is the most popular static site generator, largely due to its adoption by GitHub.

### What is a static site?

> A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page) is a web page that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.
> Consequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a web server to negotiate content-type or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so

### Resources that helped me to learn Jekyll

    > This is documentation of Jekyll. It contains in depth explanation about things like how to use tags, collections. How to take advantage of them and combine them with liquid to build the webpage etc 

-   [Mike Dane's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB)  
    > Most of what is persent in youtube is quite impossible to understand but this guy here talks us through a lot of basics of Jekyll and in fact it was his videos that helped me intially run Jekyll in my own Laptop and play with it before realising that static sites where a thing.
