## MindMaps from various self help books that I read

(Work in progress)

### [THINK AND GROW RICH BY NAPOLEON HILL](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30186948-think-and-grow-rich)

> "In 1908 Hill had the oppotunity to interview industrialist and philanthropist [Andrew Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie) for a series of articles on successful and famous men. It was at this time that Carnegie introduced Hill to his secret formula of sucess. Carnegie believed that his formula should be accessible by all and entrusted Hill with the task of collating this information and studying successful people and their application of the formula"  
> This arduous endeavor of [Napoleon Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Hill) led to the publication of 'The law of success' in 1928 and later in 1937 'Think and grow rich'.  
> I believe that most of the self help book that came out of west since the publication of 'Think and grow rich' are paraphrasing or resampling the knowledge from the book.  
> Even though I am not a strict disciple of this book but the knowledge within is a great treasure that I find useful to ground myself and focus on my goals especially after a big failure or a disaster i.e., when starting from scratch.  
> I look at these mind maps for ideas. Like when I am thinking of doing something differently for example how to organise my coding notes or when I feel low.

### [DEEP WORK BY CAL NEWPORT](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work)

> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your
> cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to
> replicate.  
> Yes, I want to deep work because I want to create something useful. Even though certains things that [Prof Cal Newport](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/147891.Cal_Newport) talks about is common knowledge in academia. This book was a good read because of the time and space of the book i.e, the book is grounded in the present day reality of insidious apps and social networks mercilessly fighting for our attention.
> Even though the mindmap is not complete I have summarised the practical aspects of this book.

### This mind map is from the book ['The Pragmmatic Programmer' by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer)

> Recently I began to code and fell in love with all things computer science. I was reading this textbook to understand what it means to be a progammer and in the first chapter these guys talks about how to build a knowledge portfolio which I found useful obviously as it can guide me in my journey.
