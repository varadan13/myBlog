There are many things that Mr Covid taught me but one important lesson is that sometimes researchers think globally while the common populace think locally. Sounds like a dialogue produced by Mr Narendra Modi's speech writers nonetheless I bet this lack of coordination between two distinct subspecies of human beings created problems like these:

And more righteous among us responded with anger, contempting these behaviour of lesser human beings in Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc and due to positive feedback loop that spawned even more contempt and anger. Awesome.    

Disclaimer I am no scientist and I think 75% of what I will tell may not be scientifically falsifiable. I wrote this as a matter of simple writing exercise to remind me about the foolies that I entertained when I was young if I get the oppertunity to grow old.  

OK.  

Let me explain what I mean by 'Thinking Locally' and 'Thinking Globally'.    

> In the beginning most computer scientists, epidemologists and other intellectuals where like Mr Ray Kurzeil talking about the possible dangers of exponential growth in number of cases. Where they right to be concerned? Of course. Did their prediction come to fruition? Very quickly indeed and I should say that itself is an outlier nevertheless we did see an exponential rise in covid cases for some time. Here according to me the researchers are thinking globally. To understand that I must tell you about the templated response of an ignorant utility maximising economical machines that is common people in this situation.   

> Let us without any difficulty ignore the existence of media. When there is a pandemic, in a media less world, looming across the horizon what will we do? We will think about it for a second or two that is the biggest exercusion some of us would dare to do. Well I am interested in what is happening behind our mind when we think about a looming disaster which given history as never happened in our recorded memories. We will unconsciously delve into the realm of probabilities, our mind will say 'Ok cool now there is a pandemic, as they say, will it kill me? Probably. Well how probably? may be less than the chance of dying from a car crash. Oh! So why bother? Let us go out and enjoy our daily rat race and see what happens!' then we go out, do our jobs then in the night or when ever we unwind our mind thinks 'Well nothing happened to us or to people around us, why should we bother?' 

> What do you think our mind is doing? It is sort of trying to churn out new expectations of the world from prior expectations. In fact our mind is using Bayes Theorem to compute what is going to happen today given all the new infomation that we have. I  wrapped the fancy term 'Thinking Locally' around this type of utilitarian selfishness. We think like this most of the time. Why? To live in the imaginary world of economics our mind must do this doesn't it?. How does local thinking differ from global thinking? Global thinking is like macroeconmics it is all about the society. Even though we are part of society we mostly don't do stuff that benefits the society, do we? This time around when scientist got on TV and spoke about Covid things where mostly about graphs, Ro and exponential growth nothing about people or how we must ground our reality with these developments. Even now people don't understand why we had to stay away from each other. When someone think globally they focus too much on the bigger picture and lose sight of smaller details; details that people are ignorant; details that infomation must be packaged correctly to get some what ideal response from people. I am not accussing any one here. After all this pandemic was a complete nuclear bomb on our lean economic system and none of us were wise enough to tackle it properly. I think infomation in the future must be packaged properly. And I don't see that to be the case in the future if the media continues its current trend of spreading fear and hatred. All our epidemilogists and scientists had to do were to tell people to stay at home not for their sake but for the society's sake and if they don't do that it will properly affect them. As Charlie Chaplin once said 'We think too much and feel too little' and feeling too little about the perspective of people costs us lot of lives and money. It is still not addressed in the media like always, I guess, we are going to shove it under our beds and forget about the problem. I hope somebody in the science rooms pick up this mistake and point it out to their peers as avoiding it could help us make advances in solving Climat change. I believe all we need is a carefully prepared API that puts all the scary details and sensational reports under the hood and talk to people like people. I believe to make this progress the local thoughts must be aligned with the global thoughts and responsible people must not only proclaim things from a pedestal like Kings and Shamons but come down to earth and talk to people like people and here people includes businesses.
