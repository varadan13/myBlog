## DATA ANALYTICS AND STATISTICS PROJECT

I have hosted some of my finished and unfinished works in my [github profile](https://github.com/varadan13/Projects_and_Notes)

- [Policy lead Prediction](https://aneeshvaradan.medium.com/my-preliminary-analysis-of-policy-lead-prediction-7430197873a5)
> - It is a classification problem and was part of a hackathon conducted by Analytics Vidhya on February 2021.
> - Used the following python packages in this project: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, etc.
> - Was able to successfully classify a success and a failure using the scikit-learn implementation of Light Gradient Boosting Machine.

- [Wikipedia pageview Dashboard.](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-very-simple-wikipedia-pageview-dashboard-using-voila-897b666d11cd)
> - In this project used the Wikipedia API to grab the pageview statistics to construct a very interactive dashboard right within the jupyter notebook.
> - This notebook was successfully transformed into a fully functional dashboard using voila (a python package)

- [Kerala Assembly Election Analytics](https://github.com/varadan13/Projects_and_Notes/tree/main/Kerala-Assembly-Election-Analytics)
> - The 2021 Kerala Legislative Assembly election is scheduled to be held in May of this year to elect 140 MLAs to the 15th Kerala Legislative Assembly.    
> - I am not a political pundit but I thought to myself it would be nice to know how various individuals and various other political parties fared in the previous elections.   
> - The data was collected from the website of Election Commission of India. The ipython notebook is semi interactive.  
> - In the future I plan to collect demographic data from Registar General office of India and conduct a more detailed study combining both the data set.  

- [Flight delay prediction](https://github.com/varadan13/Projects_and_Notes/blob/main/flight_delay_predictions.ipynb)  
> - I developed a model aimed at predicting flight delays. The intended purpose of this project was not to obtain the best possible prediction but rather to emphasize on the various steps needed to build such a model.  
> - During the EDA, I intended to create good quality figures from which the information would be easily accessible at a first glance. 

## OTHER PROJECTS  

- [Created a static website for myself and hosted it in Github.](https://github.com/varadan13/varadan13.github.io)   
> - There are hundred different ways to have a blog but I choose a semi-difficult way to create a blog for my own.  
> - I used Jekyll to create my static website. Jekyll is semi difficult to work backwards where to use the liquid templating language appropriately or to understand the mistakes that one makes during the configuration or how to put together various elements etc
> - I build the website first in my local machine and then pushed my local repo to the remote github repo.   
> - Today, it is easy for me to understand various static site generators, for example, Pelican a python static site generator.

- Meta-analysis to evaluate the success rates of various surgical techniques for socket preservation in the esthetic zone.
> - Was able to extract all the possible treatment effects from the sampled research materials and then use random effect model to draw inference.
> - The tools used in this project were Revman and Excel.
> - Excel was used to organise ideas and generate an approximate forest plot whereas Revman was used to create the final output of the analysis.
